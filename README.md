Project Overview 

•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing within Excel to ensure data quality and consistency.

•	Pivot Tables and Charts: Utilizing Excel's pivot tables and charting features, we've created visualizations to uncover trends and insights related to different aspects of the dataset.

•	Sales Analysis Dashboard: The project culminates in a visual dashboard created entirely within Excel. This interactive dashboard provides an overview of the sales data and allows users to explore key metrics and trends.


Enhanced Data Visualization

To enhance our analysis, we introduced new columns:
I have created two new columns from the existing order date column to analyze monthly and yearly sales insights.

•	Month: The month when the order was placed.

•	Year: The year when the order was placed


Business Insights

Our analysis yielded valuable business insights:

•	Customer Count by Year: You can compare customer counts across different years, making it easy to see which years had higher or lower customer engagement.

•	Sales by State: Explored the distribution of sales across different State.

•	Top 5 Customers: Identified the top five customers based on their purchasing behavior.
